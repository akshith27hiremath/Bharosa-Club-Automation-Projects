# Regex and Selenium projects for Bharosa Club

## I interned for a FinTech company in 2021, and two of my projects they assigned me are showcased here. I code in node.js and Python usually, but was asked to learn ruby for these projects as the CTO informed me their production code base is written in ruby.

## See folders for comprehensive READMEs. <br>
1. Regex Bond Ratings Data Extraction

Used regex within Ruby in order to clean and extract data from a csv file of companies' bond ratings. <br> <b>I believe my annotations and comments to this code will give better insights into my thought processes as a developer.</b> <br><br>

2. CAS pdf retrieval with Selenium

<b> Learnt Ruby and Selenium to automate the retrieval of CAS data, where it inputs a users information whilst simulating human activity, submits the request, and retrieves the reference number and request confirmation where the PDF can be found.
<b>Important: </b> Code is now non functional as the website it parses has modified its layout since 2021. <br> 

### <b>Included</b> as it was directly used in a company's core code base to automate the onboarding over 1200 customers, so I grouped it with my other major project for this company :)

## Proof of the selenium project working can be found in the LOR in the repository.
