# Regex and Selenium projects for Bharosa Club

## I interned for a FinTech company in 2021, and two of my projects they assigned me are showcased here. I code in node.js and Python usually, but was asked to learn ruby for these projects as the CTO informed me their production code base is written in ruby.

1. Regex Bond Ratings cleaning
<b>Used regex in order to clean and extract data from a csv file of companies' bond ratings. </b> <br> I believe my annotations and comments to this code will give better insights into my thought processes as a developer.

2. CAS pdf retrieval with Selenium
<b>Important: </b> Code is now non functional as the website it parses has modified its layout since 2021. <br> <b>Included</b> as it was directly used in a company's core code base to automate the onboarding over 1200 customers, so I grouped it with my other major project for this company :)

## Proof of the selenium project working can be found in the LOR in the repository.
