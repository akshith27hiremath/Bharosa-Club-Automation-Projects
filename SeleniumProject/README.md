## CAS pdf retrieval with Selenium

## This code is now deprecated due to changes made to the original website it parses 
### I have included an excerpt from the LOR to attest to its functionality.

### Prereqs
gem install webdrivers and pip install selenium <br/>

I used Version 99.0.4844.51 (Official Build) (64-bit) chrome driver. <br />

### Project Info
For my internship at a FinTech company, they required an automated way to retrieve CAS (Consilidated Account Statement) data from an existing website, and asked me to learn Selenium and Ruby to fulfill the problem statement. This code is now being used in the company's core code base to parse hundreds of mutual fund data.
