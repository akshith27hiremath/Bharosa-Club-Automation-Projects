## CAS pdf retrieval with Selenium

## This code is now deprecated due to changes made to the original website it parses 
### I have included an excerpt from the LOR to attest to its functionality.

Ruby version: ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233) [x64-mingw32] <br />

### Project Info
